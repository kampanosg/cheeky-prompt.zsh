# zsh-cheeky-prompt
A simple yet effective ~theme~ prompt for your PERiTerm. Developed specifically for my day-to-day use within Nando's as I couldn't find one covering all my needs. Hopefully, it can spice up your terminal as well üå∂Ô∏è

The prompt features:
1. Chicken emoji (there isn't a Barci one yet)
1. Current working directory: Useful since most of the work is focused within the monorepo
1. Git information
1. Current Active GCP Cluster / GCP Project
1. Command input in new line
